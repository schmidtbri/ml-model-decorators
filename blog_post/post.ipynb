    "\n",
    "We’ll be building on top of the MLModel base class that we’ve built in a [previous blog post](https://brianschmidt-78145.medium.com/introducing-the-ml-base-package-1cc80ded39b4). The MLModel base class is designed to be wrapped around the prediction functionality of a machine learning model. It has several properties that allow a model object to describe itself to the outside world, including its name, version, and input and output schemas. The MLModel base class also requires that any class that inherits from it to implement the \\_\\_init\\_\\_() method, and the predict() method. These two methods form the most simple functionality of a machine learning model, the \\_\\_init\\_\\_() method is where model parameters are loaded, and the predict() method is where predictions are made.\n"

    "## The Decorator Pattern \n",
    "\n",
    "The decorator pattern is an object-oriented design pattern that is useful when behavior needs to be added to an object without changing the object’s class or subclassing the object’s class. A decorator is an object that “decorates” the API of the object that it is decorating while not modifying the API of the object. The decorator executes its own behavior before and after the behavior of the decorated object, in this way, the decorator instance acts as a “gateway” to the decorated object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Build a Decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "A decorator is a class that has the same API as the class that we want to decorate. In order to build a decorator, we’ll first create a Decorator base class by following these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Subclass the class we want to decorate, creating a Decorator class with the same API.\n",
    "- In the Decorator class, add an instance attribute that can point to an instance of the class that we want to decorate.\n",
    "- When instantiating the Decorator class, receive an instance of the class we want to decorate and save it to the instance attribute.\n",
    "- In the Decorator class, implement the methods of the API of the class we want to decorate, calling the methods of the instance attribute and returning the results to the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we instantiate the Decorator base class, the decorator instance will just forward all method calls to the decorated object, which is not very useful. To actually build a Decorator, we’ll need to create a subclass of it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a subclass of Decorator that overrides the methods that you want to modify, adding your own behavior.\n",
    "- Make sure that you call the corresponding methods in the instance attribute from the Decorator’s methods in order to allow the decorated object to still execute its own behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that a decorator instance can actually decorate another decorator instance, which allows us to “stack” decorators together to do more complex things. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of the Decorator Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the great benefits of decorators is the flexibility that they bring to software development. Without the use of decorators, an object’s class must be modified or subclassed in order to modify its behavior. By using decorators, we can modify the behavior just by attaching the decorator to the object. The “decoration” of an object can be done at runtime and can be configuration-driven, which means that we can change a program’s behavior quickly and easily by modifying its configuration instead of its source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another benefit of decorators in that the API of the object that is decorated does not change at all. Any other object that depends on the API of the decorated object can use it without modification and without being aware that it is decorated. The only problems that arise when applying decorators is if an object depends on another object’s specific behavior instead of its API, however this is an antipattern and should be avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet another benefit of decorators is the ability to reuse them across different parts of an application. If we need to add the same behavior to many different objects which share the same API, we can create a decorator class that implements the behavior and attach it to the specific objects that we need to modify. If we had modified the behavior of the objects by changing their class, we would force all instances of the class to have the new behavior that we needed. If we subclassed the original class to add behavior, we would be adding another level of abstraction to the design which makes everything more complicated. By using decorator instances and only attaching them only to the objects that we actually need to modify, we simplify the application’s codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding the decorator pattern to a codebase, we are able to make the whole codebase more cohesive. This is because we’re making individual classes that do one thing only.  If we need to add some extra behavior to the class, we can attach a decorator that adds only that behavior instead of adding the behavior to the original class. The single responsibility principle tells us that a class should have only one reason to change, by using decorators we can make following this principle in our code a lot easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "Decorators also encourage us to use a compositional approach to software development, which means that we create the desired behavior of the program by “composing” it from various smaller pieces of code. This is different from a hierarchical approach in which we define new behaviors by inheriting from and extending the behavior of base classes. Building software through composition is simpler in the long run because it incentivizes us to use simpler inheritance hierarchies that are easier to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decorators in the Python Language\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python programming language already has a feature called decorators, which is syntactic sugar that allows a programmer to extend the functionality of a function or class. A decorator of this type is a function that takes a function or a class as a parameter and extends it with new behavior. Functions that are “decorated” have the name of the decorator function prepended with a “@” symbol:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@my_decorator\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the decorated function is called my_function and the decorator function is called my_decorator. It’s important to understand that in this blog post, we are not talking about this kind of decorator, although it is a similar concept. A great place to learn about Python decorators is [here](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The decorator that is supported by the Python language allows you to decorate code, but does not allow for dynamic runtime behavior. That is to say, we can modify a function right after it is loaded, but not before it is executed. The type of decoration we will be building in this blog post will allow us to decorate MLModel objects at runtime, regardless of the actual code. This means that we’ll be able to add decorators are runtime from configuration, adding some flexibility to our software."

We also showed how we can quickly deploy decorators on models inside of a RESTful model service through configuration. Decorators are an easy way to add functionality to a model without having to modify the code of the model class itself. In this blog post, we deployed an UUID generator on an ML model instance without having to modify the code of the model’s class or the code of the REST model service that hosts the model. The combination of decorators and machine learning models can help us to quickly and easily deploy common functionality to many different models."
